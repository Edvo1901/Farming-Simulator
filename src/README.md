This is a basic Farming Simulator game where you can buy, grow and sell your own plant. You will also need to deal with the weed, grasshopper, plant death age, etc
throughout the game. You will have many options to choose and grow your business in a whole game. Will you be a milionaire from a farmer?

## Basic Feature
1. Till the ground: to remove weed and other things.
2. Harvest: sell fully growed plants.
3. Funds: to buy new plants and other things.
4. Plant: to grow a new plant.
5. Fight grasshopper: defeat the bad animal to protect your plants.
6. Field Summary: get a summary of your field.
7. Wait: turn to next round for everything to grow up.
8. Quit: end the game.

## Additional Feature
1. Which tutor did you speak to about additional feature?
- Mr. James Walsh
2. What is your feature?
- My feature is basically for every new turn, you will have a chance (10%) get a grasshopper one of your plant (Apple or Grain only). If you didn't remove this
grasshopper quickly, you would lose your plant in the next 2 rounds.
- On the other hand, in order to remove the grasshopper, you need to play a minigame (Rock, Paper & Scissor).
- Depend on the result you might get reward or fine.
3. How does the game work?
The game will only have 2 results:  
- If you won the game, you would get some extra
money as rewarded, you also would get reduction on the grow of Weed for the next round (20% by default to 10%) 
and you would get a Golden Tree replacement at that position, which you can sell in next turn for a random value ($1-$4).
- If you lost the game, you would lose some money as fined, you also would get increase the chance of growing Weed next round (20% by default to 33%)
and you would lose your original plant, that spot will turn to Untilled Soil.
4. How do we run it?
- Firstly, head to the game. Start planning your first plant and so on.
- Keep playing until this message show out "!!! One of your plant got Grasshopper, fight it to protect your plant!!!" 
or until you see "*" symbol on the field.
- You will an option on the interface, which is "f x y: fight grasshopper".
- Choose the location you want to fight (Be careful: Choosing a wrong spot will lead to lose a turn for nothing.).
- After you enter the format correctly, the minigame will begin.
- You can either choose "r" (Rock), "p" (Paper), "s" (Siccors).
- The results will appear after all.
- Depend on the result, you will see your reward or fine being processed.
